    - "Evan started playing piano when he was 6 years old because he got jealous of his
       brother's piano lessons, and he never stopped. Growing up in Lexington, MA, he cultivated
       a deep love for jazz at Lexington High School, and helped lead the combo and jazz ensembles
       to awards at the national Ellington, Mingus, and Berklee festivals while also earning
       solo performance awards. At Columbia University, he continued to study jazz with Bruce Barth
       as he pursued a degree in computer science. Columbia's Computer Music Center sparked Evan's interest
       in the intersection between computing and music, which led to his exploration and pursuit of music
       production."
    - "Evan graduated from Columbia in 2016 and currently lives in New York. He continues to write,
       produce, and perform creative music while working as a software engineer."
